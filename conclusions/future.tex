\begin{itemize}
  \item Improve the robustness of the advected subdomain:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Smooth the transition between non-advected and advected
      regimes via ALE.
      \item Systematically assess when the thermal field is adapted
      to an advected subdomain time-step.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Extend substepping methodologies:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Improve understanding and characterization of the time-scales
        at which the different physical processes operate.
      \item Higher order time-integration in the slow partition.
      \item Improve fast/slow partition to avoid heuristics (current).
      \item Explore alternative coupling structures and time-interpolation
        schemes within the substepping framework.
      \item Improve parallel scalability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
