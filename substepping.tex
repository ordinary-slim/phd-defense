  \framesubtitle{Final conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The AS method improved HAZ accuracy and allowed much larger
      time-steps (up to several \(T_{hs}\)), at the cost of losing SPD
      structure and increasing per-step cost by roughly a factor of 2–3.
    \item AS works best on long, simple tracks; direction
      changes and overlapping tracks shear thermal tails and can severely
      degrade accuracy, limiting applicability as a general speed-up
      technique.
    \item Substepping, via fast/slow domain partitioning with
      \(\Delta t_f\) and \(\Delta t_s \gg \Delta t_f\), provided a more
      robust and broadly applicable way to exploit time-scale disparity in
      LPBF.
