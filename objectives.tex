  \frametitle{Problematic}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item AMR is regarded as necessary for part-scale LPBF simulation
      to adress spatial scale disparity.
    \item The time scale disparity is \textbf{equally} severe,
      yet uniform-time stepping is the standard.
  \end{itemize}
  $\implies$ Largely overlooked challenge:
  reduce the number of global time-steps required
  in part-scale LPBF simulation
  while retaining time-accuracy.

  \frametitle{Objectives of this work}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Review existing methods for addressing time-stepping
      challenges in MAM.
    \item
      Explore novel methods for reducing the number of time-steps
      required in LPBF modeling.
    \item
      Validate the proposed methods on realistic
      test cases.
    \item
      Validate the underlying physical models
      and numerical methods against experimental data.
    \item
      Provide realistic speedup estimates and practical implementation guidelines
      for the proposed methods.
    \item Ensure open science and reproducibility.
