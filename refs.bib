abstract = {The current work reports the result of investigations into alternative representations of the temporal evolution of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process. In order to provide the reader with sufficient context for the following discussion, the modeling challenge and its underlying cause, as well as current attempts to provide a satisfactory solution, will be discussed. Next, the author will describe two numerical methods (multirate time integration and parallel-in-time) to better represent the temporal scales of the problem. Finally, the results of applying these methods to a two-dimensional version of the heat transfer portion of the LPBF problem will be presented, reporting on both convergence and performance behavior, which indicate the possibility of significant speedup of solution calculations (40–100 times), along with well-characterized effects on solution accuracy.}

abstract = {Numerical simulations have recently shown their potential as a robust, cheap and reliable tool for predicting the quality of components produced by metal additive manufacturing (MAM) processes. Despite the advantages of the MAM processes over conventional manufacturing methods, there is still a lack of thorough understanding on how different defects can form and originate during MAM processing. In that respect, advanced numerical techniques recently developed have the ability to predict the occurrence of such defects. These techniques have paved the way to efficiently obtain the optimal processing window for targeted mechanical properties to satisfy the end-use design requirements. The aim of this review paper is hence to present and classify numerical simulations of MAM, not solely based on their length-scale as often seen, but also based on the involved physics, as well as the modeling strategies at both the meso-scale and part-scale. The paper is arranged in the following way: First, literature describing purely conduction-based heat transfer simulations at meso-scale are presented. This is followed by a review of fluid-based simulations of increasing complexity based on the treatment of free surface of the melt pool at meso-scale. Finally, contributions based on different part-scale modeling approaches with a focus on thermo-mechanical behavior are reviewed.}

abstract = {This paper presents a Chimera approach for the thermal problems in welding and metallic Additive Manufacturing (AM). In particular, a moving mesh is attached to the moving heat source while a fixed background mesh covers the rest of the computational domain. The thermal field of the moving mesh is solved in the heat source reference frame. The chosen framework to couple the solutions on both meshes is a non-overlapping Domain Decomposition (DD) with Neumann–Dirichlet transmission conditions. Increased steadiness and accuracy within the vicinity of the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) are the main advantages of this approach. The steadiness gain allows for the use of larger time steps, which is vital in AM applications and, in particular, Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), where the disparity of time scales represents a major hurdle. Moreover, enhanced accuracy can be observed in the resulting morphology of the melt pool. It will be shown that the method addresses classical shortcomings pointed out by Goldak without requiring the use of an asymmetrical heat source profile.}

  abstract={The complex physical nature of the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) process warrants use of multiphysics computational simulations to predict or design optimal operating parameters or resultant part qualities such as microstructure or defect concentration. Many of these simulations rely on tuning based on characteristics of the laser-induced melt pool, such as the melt pool geometry (length, width, and depth). Additionally, many of numerous interacting variables that make the LPBF process so complex can be reduced and controlled by performing simple, single-track experiments on bare (no powder) substrates, yet still produce important and applicable physical results. The 2018 Additive Manufacturing Benchmark (AM Bench) tests and measurements were designed for this application. This paper describes the experiment design for the tests conducted using LPBF on bare metal surfaces, and the measurement results for the melt pool geometry and melt pool cooling rate performed on two LPBF systems. Several factors, such as accurate laser spot size, were determined after the 2018 AM Bench conference, with results of those additional tests reported here.},

abstract = {Finite element simulation of the laser powder bed fusion process is made challenging by the inherently multiscale nature of the process. When using the typical global time stepping techniques, slowly-evolving regions of the domain receive the same numerical treatment as the regions with the highest temperature rates. The current work details the implementation and evaluation of an implicit multirate method which is able to advance different regions of the domain with distinct time steps, depending on their current solution rate. Previous work indicates that this representation of the temporal scales of the problem can lead to significant reductions in wall clock run time, and it is shown herein that multirate time integration, when used with a uniform process-scale mesh, can result in speedups of approximately 19, 42, and 87 times, for domains with edge lengths of approximately 1 mm, 2 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. When used in conjunction with h-refinement (limited to two levels of refinement), the resulting speedups (taken relative to the uniform mesh) are around 28, 85, and 665 times. The method is demonstrated to converge as indicated by the literature, and its use with an AM-Bench domain is demonstrated.}
