  \begin{itemize}
     \item AS recovers accurate thermal profiles in the HAZ and enables
       larger time-steps.
     \item Trade-off: increased algebraic complexity and potential
       oscillations at subdomain discontinuities.
     \item Performance degrades for short scanning tracks; minimum track
       length $\approx 5R$ recommended.
     \item Future work: combine with substepping algorithms and explore
       alternative domain decomposition strategies.
  \end{itemize}
