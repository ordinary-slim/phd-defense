  \frametitle{Advected subdomain}
  Resolving the motion requires prohibitively small time-steps.

  Idea: \textbf{Get rid of the motion}!

  Define a subdomain $\Omega_m$ that moves with the heat source
  and solves the heat equation in its reference frame.

  Due to motion of reference frame, the heat equation in $\Omega_m$
  acquires an advection term $\longrightarrow$ \textbf{advected subdomain}
  (AS) method.
