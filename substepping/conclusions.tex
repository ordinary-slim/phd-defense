  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advected subdomain can't handle realistic scan paths}.

    \item The proposed \textbf{fully-staggered Robin--Robin substepper}
      achieves \textbf{accuracy comparable} to the
      \textbf{Dirichlet substepper of \cite{hodge2021}},
      at \textbf{slightly lower computational cost}.

    \item \textbf{Dirichlet substepper is sensitive to predictor choice};
      a \textbf{diffusion-only predictor improves stability and accuracy} at large
      \(\Delta t_s\).

    \item \textbf{Substepping speed-up is controlled by the fast/slow DOF ratio}:
      increasing \(\Delta t_s\) enlarges the fast domain \(\Omega_f\),
      which increases the number of fast DOFs and can ultimately reduce
      the achievable speed-up despite fewer macro-steps.

    \item With \textbf{first-order time integration} in \(\Omega_s\), it is
      \textbf{difficult to increase} \(\Delta t_s\) \textbf{beyond}
      \(\sim 5\,T_{hs}\), as slow-scale \textbf{diffusion becomes under-resolved}.
